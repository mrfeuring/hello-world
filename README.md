# hello-world
First repo to learn about github


A few years ago I finally made the switch to the IT field. What a change! I went from being upset about going to sleep at night (because I knew it meant I had to go through another day at work in the morning), to enjoying even the rough days. I'll never leave IT, but I am trying to refine my direction. I've always been <i>very</i> into programming, but just small follow-along-guides. Recently, I thought I would task myself with building a website; both for fun and to gain some insight on my interest in web development. I plan on starting very simple with my site (simply text and hyperlinks) and then move into a more creative feel adding CSS and Javascript. I can't wait to get started. I hope a few people out there will follow along with me and maybe even add some critiques, suggestions, and offer help when I inevitably get stuck.
